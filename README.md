# Warper

Sever-sided Fabric Mod to create simple warp points using signs. 
Includes a simple Inventory-based Warp GUI.

Write [warp] in the first line and the name of the warp point in the second line. 
By default there is a delay of 20 minutes until a warp point is activated and the minimum distance between two warp points is 50 blocks. 
This can be changed in the config file.
